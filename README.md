# project-portfolio
Curtis Brumfield 
This project is a fictisious web page for a photgrapher to see their current portfolio and allows users to book them. 
The web site allows users to view the photgraphers portfolio and allows them to book a photo shoot with the photographer.
the technologies used are .html and .css along with bootstrap CDN 
for future imporvment we will add a section to display the photgraphers instagram, also we will add a comment section for users to add comments to the photgraphers existing portfolio, and we also will improve the web page by letting the users log in and become members of the photgraphers community.
